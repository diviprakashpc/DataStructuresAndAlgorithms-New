  In partition dp,
  ->You solve in particular way ,you get some answer and solve in other way you get a different answer. And then you perform some opertions on those answers like giving min of out of them or else.
  
  ->Therefore different partitions produce different answers and we perform logical operations on those answers.
  Ex: AxBxCxD multiplication of matrices gives different total multiplications on diffrent associations.
  
  Ex.MCM,
  RodCutting problem,
  Evaluate Boolean Expression to true,
  Palindrome Partioning,
  Partition Array for Maximum Sum etc..
  
  
  I have solved all questions, next time I solve them again I would write their code here.
