Basic structure for vairable size Sliding window:

Comparison:-
->In fixed we had k as window size and we had two condition i.e when
j-i+1<k and j-i+1 == k. There was never a case when j-i+1>k.

->In variable we have k as sum( the condition given in question). 
On moving window it is possible that windowsum<k , windowsum==k and windowsum>k.


For the question,
Given an array containing N positive integers and an integer K. Your task is to find the length of the longest Sub-Array with sum of the elements equal to the given value K.(condition->sum of subarray).

The basic structure would be:-

	int i = 0;
	int j = 0;
	while(j<arr.length){
 		calculations();
 		if(condition<k){
 			j++;
 		} 	    
 		else if(condition==k){
 	 	ans <-- calculations
 	 	j++;
 		}
 		else if(condition>k){
      		while(condition>k){
       		remove_calculation_for_i();
        	i++; 
      		} 
      		j++;	
 		}    
 	     
}
