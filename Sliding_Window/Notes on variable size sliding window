Notes for Variable Size Sliding Window:

Sample Question :
Given an array containing N positive integers and an integer K. Your task is to find the length of the longest Sub-Array with sum of the elements equal to the given value K.(condition)


Diffrence between fixed size SD and variable size SD:

Fixed  --  
1)K(window size)(fixed) given and we need to maximize/minimize a condition(sum or something else).

2)We obtain a possible answer candidate when window size give in question hits i.e. j-i+1 = k.

3)In fixed SD , when we a hit the window size and obtain a possible answer, on moving the window further keeps giving us answer candidates. The window never shrinks or increases therefore making it very easy to collect answer candidates.

Variable -- 
1)Condition given(fixed), we need to maximize/minimize k i.e. the window size.

2)We obtain a possible answer candidate when the condition given in question hits.

3)In variable, when condition is hit, the current window size may or may not change. It completely depends on question. And therfore lot of questions are asked on variable SD.
                       
(Jrruri nahi h max/min hoga,example diya hai. Aise toh croro chize kr skte hai.)


Identification for Variable SD:-
1)subarray/substring
2)Condition given like sum or something. And asked the max/min window size(subarray/substring length).
