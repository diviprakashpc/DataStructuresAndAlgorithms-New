1) 2D array for LIS is diificult to understand, go for 1d array approach or binary search approach.


2)Subset is  diffrence from subsequence. Subsequence orignal order is maintained. In subset random order is legal.

Also when question that has LIS use in it asks for subsets instead of subsequence, sort the array first.

subsequence --> Ordered subset
