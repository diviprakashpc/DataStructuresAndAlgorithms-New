1)Steps for recursion:-
	-Express in terms of indexes and required parameter(like target or 	something)
	-Explore all possibilites
	-Work on those possibilites.

2)Steps for DP:-
   - Copy the basecase
   - Write changing parameters in nested loops and in opposite(opposite) fashion.
   -Copy the recourrence as it is.



3)All the questions where we need dp[i-1][j] for calculating dp[i][j], we can optimize space with prev and curr array.An example on how to do it is written in 0/1 knapsack.

4)In questions with infinite supply , when we take an element and call recursio. We keep the index same because since it is infinite supply we may need it again. Ex. Unbounded Knapsack

5)Meri tbiyt thik nahi lag rahi. Rod cutting problem 1.5 ghante ki thi , maai darta tha kitna..aaj wo bina kisi ke help se 15minute mei poori krdi. Thanks to striver for the training.
