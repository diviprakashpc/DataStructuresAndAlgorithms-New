Thinking steps in binary search:
1)Initialize your start and end.
2) Find what relation would be between arr[mid] and target we want to achieve.
3)Move start and end accordingly.
4)Think when loop will break.


It is literally not neceassary that the default binary search template works everytime. You need to tweak it to achieve your goal.
