                    MIN OF THE MAXES
In Estimation Dp, precisely project Estimation Dp we consider "Best(choice) From the worst(luck)".

Example:
Suppose you are a manager and you have to give task to four employees.

Employeee     Time take in diffrent scenarios
E1               10,9,2,11,19,22
E2               11,15,16,13,19
E3               10,9,4,3,16
E4               100,90,25,23,7

And you want the "Guaranteed Best time" that the work is completed. This means you need a guarantee that the work will get completed at that time t.

For Guranteee : We assume the worst from the luck. i.e. how much time the employee would take is luck. 
For Best : We take the best out of the choices i.e we select the employee which has the best worst time.

Worst time ensures that the work will definetly get done.

Therfore in these questions we have :
1)Choice : We choose the best from the worst options(lucks).
2)Luck : We expect the worst from all the options.

All summed up we can say we go for : "MIN OF THE MAXES".Infact in base cases too we assume worst luck for us.
